I demonstrate how to deploy a Generative AI application using Docker and Flask in this app. We will utilize Hugging Face's transformers library to implement a text-generation model based on GPT-2. The application will expose an endpoint /generate that accepts POST requests with a prompt in the JSON body. The model processes the prompt and generates text, which is then returned as a JSON response. This guide will walk you through setting up Flask, configuring the text-generation pipeline, and containerizing the application with Docker for seamless deployment.

# Step1. Preparing the Gen AI Model
The first step is to prepare the Gen AI application code. Letâ€™s assume we are deploying a text generation model using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
This is a basic script to generate text using the GPT-2 model. You can adapt it to the Gen AI model you're working with.

# Step 2. Create the Dockerfile
The next step is to write a Dockerfile containerize for the Gen AI application. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands to build the image.
This Dockerfile pulls a lightweight version of Python, installs the necessary dependencies, and runs the app.py script when the container starts.

# Step 3. Define the Dependencies
Create a requirements.txt file that lists the Python libraries required by your Gen AI application.
You can add additional dependencies based on the libraries your model requires.

# Step 4. Build the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and run the following command:
docker build -t gen-ai-app .
Here, gen-ai-app is the name of the Docker image you are building. Docker will run through the Dockerfile install the dependencies and prepare the containerized environment.

# Step 5. Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, you can run the container using the following command:
docker run -it gen-ai-app

# Testing with curl
Test the Flask route using curl. Ensure that you're making a POST request with a JSON payload.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/generate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "What is Docker?"}'
